## Project: Planning-with-Files Implementation

### 📊 Session History

#### Session 1 - Initial Implementation
**Date**: 2026-02-03  
**Start Time**: [Current session]  
**Claude Code Version**: Sonnet 4  
**Working Directory**: /Users/admin/Claude Code/seo-dashboard  

**Objectives**:
- [x] Research original planning-with-files concept
- [x] Create core planning workspace structure
- [x] Implement task_plan.md template
- [x] Implement findings.md for research tracking
- [x] Implement progress.md for session logging
- [ ] Create planning workflow functions
- [ ] Add session recovery functionality
- [ ] Create documentation and examples

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Fetched planning-with-files repository information
2. ✅ Analyzed core concept and architecture
3. ✅ Created planning-workspace directory
4. ✅ Implemented task_plan.md with phase tracking
5. ✅ Implemented findings.md with research discoveries
6. ✅ Implemented progress.md with session logging
7. 🔄 Currently working on planning workflow functions
2. ✅ Started recovery session

**Key Discoveries**:
- Original concept uses three markdown files for persistence
- Filesystem serves as "disk memory" for cross-session state
- Claude Code uses MCP servers instead of traditional "skills"
- Can implement core functionality with existing Claude Code tools

**Errors/Blockers**:
- None encountered so far

**Next Steps**:
- Create planning workflow command functions
- Implement session recovery mechanism
- Add documentation and usage examples
